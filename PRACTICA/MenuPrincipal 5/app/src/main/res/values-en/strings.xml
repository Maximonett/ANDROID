    <string name="help_text">Welcome to Small Naval Battle! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to play:\n
1. Game objective:\n
Find and sink all hidden ships on the board before running out of moves.\n
2. How the board works:\n
The board consists of a grid of buttons. Each button represents a cell where there may or may not be a ship.\n
3. How to play:\n
- Tap a cell to "shoot" at that position.\n
- If you hit a ship, the cell will turn red and you will score a hit.\n
- If there is no ship, the cell will turn blue, indicating a missed shot.\n
- Each tap counts as a move.\n
4. Counters:\n
- Moves: How many cells you have tapped.\n
- Hits: How many ships you have found.\n
- Remaining ships: How many ships are yet to be discovered.\n
5. End of the game:\n
When you find all ships, the game ends and you can see a summary of your moves and hits.\n
6. Tips:\n
- Think carefully before shooting to avoid wasting moves.\n
- Use logic to deduce where ships might be.\n
Have fun and good luck sinking the ships!</string>
